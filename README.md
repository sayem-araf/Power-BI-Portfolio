# Project: US Retail Sales Dashboard

**Description:**  
This Power BI dashboard visualizes sales performance for a US retail store. The dataset included separate tables for customers, sales, and regional information. Data was cleaned and transformed in Power Query, a data model was created linking all tables with calculated measures, and key metrics were visualized to support business decision-making.

Additionally, an Excel file provides advanced analysis of the same data, including pivot tables, KPI calculations, and exploratory insights.
